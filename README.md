# Code, Creatively.

C4 is a brand new creative-coding framework lets you build expressive user experiences and create works of art. C4 gives you the power of the native iOS programming environment with a simplified API that lets you get down to working with media right away. Build artworks, design interfaces, explore new possibilities of working with media and interaction.

## To The New Ones

Creating an expressive, intuitive mobile application is hard work. C4 makes this simple by letting you build projects that already deal with a lot of boring stuff. You get to start creating gorgeous elements faster and with more ease than tackling app development on your own.

C4 will help you learn how to make things move and interact in a very short amount of time. It is designed to look and feel like a simpler version of Objective-C, so that when you're ready to venture out on your own, the step from build C4 apps to native mobile applications for iOS is tiny.

## To The Crazy Ones

If you're already a developer and you know the ins and outs of developing for mobile platforms C4 still has a lot to offer you. First, C4 approaches animation and interaction in a synthetic way so that all its media objects are consistent and similar. If you want to learn from the way we build things the API is open. If you don't want to learn how we do things, but just get down to using the core API you can include a compiled C4 library in your own projects and take advantage of all the work we've been doing (you can pull the headers and the libC4.a file from a project built off of an Xcode template).


## How To Get Started

If you just want to get started building with C4, follow the [Get Started tutorial](http://www.c4ios.com/tutorials/getstarted). If you are a more advanced user or want to contribute to C4  clone the GitHub repository and open the project file.

Then read the [documentation](http://www.c4ios.com/docs/), follow some [tutorials](http://www.c4ios.com/tutorials/) and look at some [examples](http://www.c4ios.com/examples/).

## Get Involved

The C4 community is just starting to grow. To get involved, we suggest the following

* **Start building!** Use the API, abuse it, do what you want with it.

* Contribute to the Q&A. Use the [C4 tag in StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c4?sort=votes) or see the [StackOverflow tutorial](http://www.c4ios.com/tutorials/stackoverflow.php).

* Submit new issues. Go to the [C4iOS Issues page](https://github.com/C4Framework/C4iOS/issues) and start adding to it by posting new issues or suggesting fixes.
