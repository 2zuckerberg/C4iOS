C4 is a Creative-Coding API designed for producing expressive, interactive mobile applications on iOS.

The project was started in 2012 with the help of the Alberta College of Art + Design and the Innovis Lab at the Universityt of Calgary.

The first official release of the project was in September 2012.

The first major update for the project will be in June 2013, which will include tons of bug fixes, functionality upgrades and additional objects and headers for the API. This release will also include new documentation for the API, 125 new online examples, and 20 new in-depth tutorials for learning how to work with C4.

We have put a lot of effort into the project and are really excited to see what kinds of artworks and applications will be made with C4 in the near future.

Thanks for having a look at our project and we hope you like working with it!
