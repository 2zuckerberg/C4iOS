This is the README for the C4iOS project.

C4iOS is an early alpha release of a new programming API for iOS (currently only iPad).

I finished the first release on March 19th, 2012 and subsequently ran workshops for 3 weeks thereafter at the Alberta College of Art + Design. 
In May I directed a residency with 4 participants for 4 weeks, resulting in a lot of new development for the API.

Currently, I am working on a publication about C4 as well as pushing to get a new website with content up and rolling.

The new site / content should be up by mid-August 2012.
